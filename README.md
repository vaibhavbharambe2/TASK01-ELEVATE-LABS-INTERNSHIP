# TASK01-ELEVATE-LABS-INTERNSHIP
Created to store all the files for Elevate Labs internship Task 1 held on 4th August 2025.

Created a Calculator app in Python that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division for not just two but multiple input values.

To do so, I created a list and added all the entered numbers to it in order to perform calculations and obtain the results. I ensured that the entered numbers are in the form of integers and decimal numbers only. Additionally, I handled exceptions for invalid characters and division by zero cases.

The calculator runs until the user explicitly exits the app.

Programming language used: Python (Functions, Loops, List)
Tool: PyCharm
